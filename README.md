# Small and modular TCP Server
QUOY Server is a simple, small and modular TCP server written in Python. It uses classic fork-based command handling architecture.
It is a heart of one of subsystems in my own cloud - it plays a role of console server.

A documentation with a specific standard of default communication protcol - Q.U.O.Y Protocol - will be added soon.
P.S. QUOY relates to an animal - a quoy. As an acronym it stands for Quick-and-Useful Only Yours Protocol.
